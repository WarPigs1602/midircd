midircd - INSTALL
==========================
Last updated: July 2025

Requirements:
-------------
- GNU make
- gcc (or a compatible C compiler)
- Standard Unix build tools (sh, sed, etc.)
- A TLS/SSL library such as OpenSSL is required for encrypted client/server connections.

Build instructions:
-------------------
1. Change to the source directory:
   cd midircd

2. Configure the build system:
   ./configure

   For available options, run:
   ./configure --help

3. Build the server:
   make

4. Install midircd (as root if necessary):
   make install

Configuration:
--------------
- Copy and edit the example configuration:
   cp doc/example.conf $HOME/lib/ircd.conf
  Adjust the configuration to your network and server needs. Start with a minimal config and expand as needed.

- If upgrading from an older version, use the provided convert-conf tool to migrate your configuration:
    $PREFIX/bin/convert-conf old.conf > new.conf

Running:
--------
- Start the server using the installed binary. Make sure your configuration file is in place and permissions are correct.

Support:
--------
- If you encounter build problems, ensure your environment meets the requirements. For persistent issues, collect system details (OS, architecture, configure options, error logs) and contact the development team.

Good luck!
