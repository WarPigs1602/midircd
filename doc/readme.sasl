# SASL Support in IRCd

## Overview

This IRCd implements SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) to provide secure authentication for clients. SASL allows the use of various authentication mechanisms such as PLAIN, EXTERNAL, or SCRAM.

## Enabling SASL

1. Ensure that SASL-related modules (`m_sasl.c`, `s_auth.c`, `s_auth.h`) are included in the build.
2. Check the configuration for SASL-specific options (e.g., enabled mechanisms, authentication backend).

## Usage

- Clients can authenticate using the `AUTHENTICATE` command as described in the [IRCv3 SASL specification](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/sasl-3.1.html).
- Supported mechanisms are advertised during connection registration.
- Upon successful authentication, the user is marked as verified.

## Developer Notes

- The main SASL logic is implemented in `ircd/m_sasl.c` and `ircd/s_auth.c`.
- Additional mechanisms can be added by extending these files.
- Error and status codes are defined in `include/ircd_reply.h` and `ircd/s_err.c`.
